# Regex-form-validation--js
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. -mdn web docs

In this project I used regular expressions in javascript to validate strings in the DOM input fields.
